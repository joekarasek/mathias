                        <p class="pediatric-slab__copy">While most adults would agree with the importance of protecting their adult teeth, many overlook the developmental significance of the primary dentition, or "baby teeth." Most pediatric dental patients have both adult and baby teeth, or mixed dentition, and a pediatric dental specialist understands how proper care of both can lead to a lifetime of healthy smiles.</p>

                        <p class="frenectomy-slab__copy">Well before your baby is born, you are committed to doing everything possible to help him or her grow up happy, strong and healthy. Sometimes, you both need extra help to accomplish this, and one common but easily treated problem some parents and infants face is a restrictive frenum. This is also called a frenulum and is commonly known as tongue-tie or lip-tie.</p>
